# Taxi trip in New York City

New York City is a huge metropolis full of traffic. When someone is in a rush, it might be a good idea to take a taxi. In this notebook we analyze data of trips by two transportation companies such as pickup/dropoff time/location, number of passengers etc  and try to draw useful conclusions. Moreover, we attempt to evaluate the critical factors that cause delays and predict the duration of future trips based on test data.
